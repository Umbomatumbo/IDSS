# Project of Intelligent Decision Support System

## Abstract

Our Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) represents a cutting-edge solution for predicting students' academic outcomes. This web-based application leverages a comprehensive dataset, integrating traditional student features with an expert opinion component. The system is designed to empower users, particularly educational institutions, with valuable insights for student support and academic planning.

## Key Features

### 1. Predictive Modeling
- Utilizes a diverse dataset to predict students' academic outcomes.
- Incorporates traditional student features for accurate predictions.

### 2. Expert Opinion Component
- Allows users to input responses to ten interview-like questions, scored by an expert.
- Enhances prediction accuracy by considering qualitative insights.

### 3. Web Application
- Implemented as a user-friendly web application for easy accessibility.

### 4. Model Customization
- Offers basic and advanced configurations to suit user preferences.
- Enables users to tailor the system according to their specific needs.

## System Usage
